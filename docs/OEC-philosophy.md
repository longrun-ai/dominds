# Overall Every Control and Clear (OEC)

> Haier: Overall Every(thing/one/day) Control/Clear

The OEC Management Method is a comprehensive enterprise management framework created by Haier Group in 1989, also known as "全方位优化管理法" (Comprehensive Optimization Management Method). This philosophy has generated tremendous economic and social benefits for Haier, earning them the National Enterprise Management Innovation "Golden Horse Award" and the Enterprise Reform "Sail Cup", with Premier Zhu Rongji批示 recommending nationwide promotion of this management experience.

## Core Philosophy

OEC represents a systematic approach to daily management that emphasizes **"Daily work completion, daily clearance, daily improvement"** (日事日毕、日清日高). The fundamental principle is that every employee must accomplish targeted work every day, with the overall goal being to achieve a 1% improvement over the previous day's performance.

## The OEC Components

### **O - Overall (全方位)**

- **Global Integration**: All activities, processes, and systems are interconnected
- **Holistic Thinking**: Every element contributes to the overall organizational success
- **Strategic Alignment**: Daily activities support long-term strategic objectives

### **E - Everyone, Everything, Everyday (每人、每事、每日)**

- **Everyone**: Every employee has clear responsibilities and accountability
- **Everything**: Every task, process, and outcome is managed and controlled
- **Everyday**: Daily operations, reviews, and improvements are non-negotiable

### **C - Control and Clear (控制和清晰)**

- **Clear Standards**: Defined expectations, processes, and quality benchmarks
- **Controlled Processes**: Systematic monitoring and adjustment mechanisms
- **Transparent Accountability**: Clear visibility into performance and outcomes

## Three Fundamental Principles

### 1. **Closed-Loop Management (闭环原则)**

- **PDCA Cycle**: Plan-Do-Check-Act continuous improvement
- **Complete Accountability**: Every task has clear ownership and follow-through
- **Systematic Follow-up**: No loose ends or unaddressed issues

### 2. **Comparative Analysis (比较分析原则)**

- **Internal Benchmarking**: Compare current performance with past achievements
- **External Benchmarking**: Measure against industry best practices and international standards
- **Competitive Intelligence**: Use comparison as a driver for improvement

### 3. **Continuous Optimization (不断优化原则)**

- **Weakest Link Theory**: Identify and strengthen薄弱环节 (weak areas)
- **Incremental Progress**: 1% daily improvement compounds significantly over time
- **Systematic Enhancement**: Continuous refinement of all processes

## Implementation Framework

### Daily Work Completion (日事日毕)

**Core Mechanisms:**

- **3E Card System**: Everyone, Everything, Everyday tracking
- **Daily Planning**: Clear daily targets and responsibilities
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous oversight throughout the workday

**Practical Implementation:**

- Morning briefings establish daily objectives
- Mid-day check-ins ensure progress tracking
- Evening reviews confirm completion and identify issues

### Daily Clearance (日清日高)

**The "Three Management Principles":**

1. **Daily Affairs Daily Completion**
   - Address all problems and anomalies on the same day
   - Clarify responsibilities and implement corrective measures
   - Prevent problem accumulation through immediate action

2. **Daily Clearance with Management Support**
   - Self-clearance by employees, complemented by organizational oversight
   - Structured follow-up and verification processes

3. **Daily Improvement Focus**
   - Identify and address weak links in processes
   - Implement continuous enhancements
   - Target 1% daily improvement for exponential growth

### Quality Control System

**Management Process:**

- **Problem Identification**: 5W3H1S Analysis
  - **What**: What problem occurred
  - **Where**: Where did it happen
  - **When**: When did it occur
  - **Who**: Who is responsible
  - **Why**: Root cause analysis
  - **How Many**: Scope of impact
  - **How Much**: Cost implications
  - **How**: Solution approach
  - **Safety**: Safety implications

**Quality Accountability Tools:**

- **Quality Value Vouchers**: Red (reward) and Yellow (penalty) system
- **Three-tier Inspection**: Self-inspection, mutual inspection, professional inspection
- **Real-time Feedback**: Immediate correction and recognition

## Real-World Case Study: Haier's Transformation

### The 76 Refrigerators Moment (1985)

In early 1985, CEO Zhang Ruimin gathered all employees at the Qingdao Refrigerator General Factory and publicly destroyed 76 defective refrigerators with sledgehammers. These refrigerators, worth RMB 1,100 each (equivalent to four times annual employee salary), were smashed despite having minor defects like paint chips.

**Psychological Impact:**

- Employees swung hammers with tears in their eyes
- The message was crystal clear: substandard products would not be tolerated
- This became the symbolic turning point for quality transformation

### Before OEC Implementation (1984)

**Company State:**

- Revenue: Only 3.48 million RMB
- 13 initial management rules included basic requirements like "don't urinate or defecate in work areas"
- Shanghai Department Store reported all 22 purchased washing machines were defective
- Inventory included 6,322 surplus defective washing machines
- Defective products were sold as a separate product category

### After OEC Implementation (1990s-Present)

**Transformation Results:**

- Global expansion to over 180 countries
- Revenue growth to tens of billions of dollars
- Market leadership in home appliances
- Recognized as a model for socialist enterprise transformation

**Key Success Factors:**

- Cultural transformation from top management commitment
- Systematic implementation of daily management practices
- Employee engagement through clear accountability
- Continuous improvement culture

## Modern Applications and Adaptations

### Manufacturing Excellence

- **Lean Manufacturing Integration**: OEC complements and enhances lean methodologies
- **Six Sigma Implementation**: Quality control through systematic daily management
- **Just-in-Time Production**: Reduced waste through precise daily coordination

### Service Industry Applications
